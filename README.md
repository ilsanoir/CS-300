# CS-300

This course focused largely on algorithms, their various applications (focusing on which one was more efficient in certain applications), and understanding the structure of popular algorithms and their implementation. For this project, the aim was to choose an algorithm (in this case the binary search tree) and apply it to sort and print requested information from a list of courses and their prerequisites.

For this problem the largest consideration was the nature of the data, how much data was to be handled, amd the scalability of the data structure. Considering the potential for future changes, additions and deletions, the binary search tree was the best fit. Having the knowledge of various sorting algorithms enabled me to be able to make this decision and apply it to this specific problem.

Most roadblocks I encountered were solved by either revisiting the material offered thorughout the CS-300 course, or going online to look for external resources on how to implement some parts of the code.

This course has mostly made me more aware of how important having knowledge is. Even without full understanding of a particular coding language, having the knowledge of certain concepts, patterns and structures goes a very long way to being able to solve problems.

This course also highlighted how important it is to be able to employ the correct algorithm (or algorithms) to a particular code in order to achieve the desired result.
